* How to use

You can use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to easily place the dotfiles in your home dir.
For example, in order to install the =Emacs= config files:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/eliseuv/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
stow emacs/
#+END_SRC

Or if the repo was cloned to somewhere other than =$HOME=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stow -d .dotfiles/emacs/ -t ~/
#+END_SRC

* Arch Packages

On Arch based distros you can install all the packages needed by executing:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pacman -S --needed - < pkglist.txt
#+END_SRC

For installing foreign packages you can use your favorite AUR helper, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
paru -S --needed - < foreignpkglist.txt
#+END_SRC
