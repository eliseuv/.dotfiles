* How to use

You can use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to easily place the dotfiles in your home dir.
For example, in order to install the i3wm dotfiles:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/eliseuv/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow i3/
#+END_SRC

Or if the repo was cloned to somewhere other than =$HOME=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stow -d dotfiles/i3/ -t ~/
#+END_SRC

* Packages

On an Arch based distro you can install all the packages needed by executing:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pacman -S --needed - < pkglist.txt
#+END_SRC

For installing foreign packages you can use your favorite AUR helper, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
paru -S --needed - < foreignpkglist.txt
#+END_SRC

* Chemacs and DOOM Emacs

In order to use [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][Chemacs2]], clone [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][DOOM Emacs]] repo to =~/.config/doom= dir.
