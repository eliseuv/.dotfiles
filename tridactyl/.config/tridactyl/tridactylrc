" " WARNING: This file defines and runs a command called fixamo_quiet. If you
" " also have a malicious addon that operates on `<all_urls>` installed this
" " will allow it to steal your firefox account credentials!
" "
" " With those credentials, an attacker can read anything in your sync account,
" " publish addons to the AMO, etc, etc.
" "
" " Without this command a malicious addon can steal credentials from any site
" " that you visit that is not in the restrictedDomains list.
" "
" " You should comment out the fixamo lines unless you are entirely sure that

" "
" " The advantage of running the command is that you can use the tridactyl

" " Provided only as an example.
" " Do not install/run without reading through as you may be surprised by some
